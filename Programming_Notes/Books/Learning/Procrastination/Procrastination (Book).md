# Why I read this book
Procrastination is a feature of my life I no longer want. Figuring out methods of how to handle it is really important to me.

# Chapter 1
## Thoughts
They define procrastination as 
> Short term mood regulation over the pursuit of long term goals.

or as
>The voluntary and unnecessary delay of intended action despite the recognition that it will have negative consequences.

Not all delays are forms of procrastination. Sometimes delays occur due to lack of knowledge of the task or reprioritization.
## Actionable Steps
- Try to recognise the consequences of your actions.
# Chapter 2
Procrastination can have lots of unintended outcomes. However it is the source of the procrastination that we should look for.
If you are procrastinating to avoid unpleasant feelings, this can be cope. Furthermore, it can lead you to negative career opportunities as people may not even apply for other jobs. The jobs they have may not be autonomous or highly paid. 

# Chapter 3
## Thoughts
Procrastination can even affect physical and mental health. It causes people to delay sleep and can even prevent people from seeking help with these issues. This is compounded by the fact that it may not even help you get the relief you are looking for. Knowing that you are procrastinating can prevent you from enjoying the relief that you are partaking in.

## Actionable steps
- Add a procrastination lens to that guide.

# Chapter 4
## Thoughts
Procrastination can have social consequences. Connections may be lost and opportunities may be missed out on. Furthermore, procrastinators tend to have a more negative view of themselves and other procrastinators.
People who procrastinate may have a perceived lack of support. This may not be real.

## Actionable Steps
- Ask myself when I am procrastinating if the reason for it is because I think people won't support me.

# Chapter 5
## Thoughts
Procrastination is more focused on avoiding unpleasant feelings tied to the task rather than the task itself. It is the result of poor mood regulation.
Another issue we have is that we idealise our  future self. We give them tasks that we cannot handle in the hopes that they succeed. This temporal shift is ineffective and will cause failure. Avoid this. Identify with the future self.

## Actionable Steps.
- Create a system to identify with the future self. This will be discussed further in chapter 9.

# Chapter 6
Identity and task uncertainty can lead to procrastination. 
People with high self esteem and low self esteem react to success the same way. It is in difficult times their behaviour differs.
Low self esteem can be a negative feedback loop. You can continually cause situations that make you feel like you can't do things.
Self blame can give you a sense of control at the expense of your self esteem. Sometimes this can be a forced sense of control(?).
Perfectionism is self destructive as you will select options that you will win in.
This resonated with me.
High personal standards are a defense against procrastination. Become aware of your own self worth and possibilities.

# Chapter 7
## Thoughts
Self compassion has three core elements.
1. Responding with self compassion rather than self criticism.
2. Feeling connected to our suffering rather than isolated.
3. Being mindful of our emotions.

Self compassion and forgiveness are two important techniques for combating procrastination..
Self indulgence is not self compassion.
People who struggle with self compassion that need the message are also the most likely to not hear it.
Two exercises in this chapter. Go through them at some point.
Self compassion is for in the moment procrastination. Self forgiveness is for previous actions.

# Chapter 8

## Thoughts
If you are a perfectionist, then achieving goals and challenges without incidence is a badge of self worth, whereas any sign of trouble spells defeat.
Mindset is important.
Crystal ball: We tend to overestimate the impact and duration of negative emotions. This is true even for events that will occur in the near future.
We tend to use this crystal ball to judge our actions.
Focus on the process over goals. We do need a goal but it should not be everything. Also goals evolve. 
Make meaning and enjoyment within the process. Focus on the why of your goals.

# Chapter 9

## Thoughts
Procrastination can be a trick to prevent you/disconnect you from your future self. People can see their future selfs as abstract and less concrete. There are strategies to bridge that gap.
The first is to introduce inter temporal strategies. Don't just imagine the person at the start and end but also the intermediate steps in between. This reduces the negative feelings.
The second is to do perspective shifting. Imagine writing a letter to and from your future self. The reply is important in helping build connection. The time frame can be tricky bu try experimentation.
## Actionable Steps
- Introduce letter writing to prep.
- Introduce monthly letter correspondence.
- Introduce methods of future self to combat Jake.

# Chapter 10
## Thoughts
Not what I expected. This chapter was broken into three parts: Ready, set, go.
Ready: Define the task. Break it into smaller pieces if necessary.
Set: Set up your environment to succeed. This can be removing false positive distractions.
Go: Just do it.

## Actionable Steps.
- In prep, clarify the task.
- When examining non-actions, look at it from the lens of the task.
- Recognise that you did a good job.
