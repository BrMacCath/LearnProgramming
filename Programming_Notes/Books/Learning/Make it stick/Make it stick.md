# Why I Read This Book
I have realised that my methods of learning have significant flaws. Reading a book that talks through misconceptions about learning can help me realign my processes in a more effective manner.

# Motivation to read book

# Chapter 1 
## Thoughts

- [[Cognitive Load]] is necessary to learn new topics. Simply reading things can give an [[Illusions of fluency]] or competency.
- Try solve problems first. Try extract [[Underlying principles]].
- Through [[Elaboration|elaboration]] we can extend what you think you know.
- Struggle can help you determine what you need to focus on.
- Repetition can lead to ignoring important components. 
- [[Illusions of fluency]] can happen when students think reading is sufficient. 
- [[Testing Effect|Testing]] is a tool that can help with [[Retrieval Practice]] and identify [[Unknown Unknowns]].

## Actionable steps
- Before studying, write down a genuine reason to study this. Make it matter.
- Create a method of testing yourself.
- Create links between different areas of knowledge.

# Chapter 2
## Thoughts
- [[Reflection]] is an important part of practice.
- [[Testing Effect|Testing]] can be a learning strategy with the effect of preventing forgetting. It also helps figure out [[Unknown Unknowns]].
- Creativity uses basic facts. We cannot access our creativity without the tools to create with them.
- [[Generation]] can aid in learning. Even having replacing letters with _ can help with learning.
- [[Retrieval Practice]] can be done after reading a passage. For instance writing 10 facts you learned from reading a passage afterwards.
- [[Delayed feedback]] can lead to deeper learning. It is *hypothesized* that the feedback could become a crutch students use to learn material.
- [[Retrieval Practice]] is more efficient the more effortful the process. Essays are more useful than multiple choice.
## Actionable Steps

- Test yourself after reading something. Focus on effortful processes.
- Try to implement some form of [[Delayed feedback]].
# Chapter 3
## Thoughts
- Sometimes we overvalue immediate benefits. Dr K talked about this with medication versus psychotherapy with ADHD patients. The medication has a more immediate but smaller effect so people think that that is more valuable. In studies though, we find that the psychotherapy is more beneficial.
	- How do they measure this? 
- Massed unvaried practice can lead to the belief of a more significant improvement as we can witness the change. The effect is less as the difficulty is where we learn.
- Short term learning strategies are different to long term learning strategies.
- [[Spaced Repetition|Spaced practice ]] that involves [[Interleaving practice|interleaving]] is more useful for long term strategies.
- The method of learning can change where in the brain it is stored.
- Interleaving helps you decide which skill you should use.
- Practice like you perform.
- Blind repetition can induce filtering.

## Actionable steps
- Flash cards. I will need to figure that one out for obsidian.

# Chapter 4
## Thoughts
- [[Encoding]] is the process of turning information into memory.
- [[Consolidation]] of memory is also important. We need to be able to chunk things together.
- [[Retrieval]] is vital as without that, the process becomes pointless.
- I did not even think about [[Knowledge Cues]] consciously. This will have to be something I consider in future.
- Easier isn't better. Reconsolidation is better than reading.
- Create [[Mental models]].
- Sometimes interference can be helpful as it forces us to use [[Generation|generation]]. This has limits though.
- Question yourself to see if you understand these things. [[Elaboration]].
- [[Write to learn]] can be a valuable technique to learn things.
## Actionable Steps
- Write mini essays after chapters. 

# Chapter 5
## Thoughts
- Two systems of thinking, fast and slow. Reactive versus thoughtful. Both are useful.
- Hunger for narrative can change interpretations and distract us from reality. One sided conversations are more distracting than a regular converstaion.
- Common mistakes people make in their alignment are [[Feeling of knowing]], [[Imagination Inflation]].
- [[Mental models]] can make it hard to teach as you may have filtered out difficulties.
- Pay attention to [[Knowledge Cues|cues]].
## Actionable steps
- Create assessment tools that remove personal bias.

# Chapter 6
## Thoughts
- You need to believe in yourself.
- We have a vast range of skills that we can use and combine together in different ways.
- [[Dynamic testing]] is a really useful method to figure out [[Unknown Unknowns]].
- [[Structure Building]] is important. It can help you add or remove necessary information.
- Story can be sttructure.
- Some people are "example learners". Comparing two examples side by side can help them learn.
- Distill the principles.

## Actionable steps
When studying, try see how things work!

# Chapter 7
## Thoughts
- Brain is a wilderness of natural resources but you need to make connections between them to take advantage of them.
- The hippocampus is involved in generating new brain cells. This starts to happen before and after learning new things.
- Small differences in aptitudes combined with an environment that supports them can lead to massive changes over the long term.
- Three things to help us grow: [[Growth Mindset]], deliberate practice and [[Knowledge Cues|memory cues]]. (I keep forgetting about memory cues)
- There are two common goal approaches people take, performance goals or learning goals. Performance goals lead people to take on challenges that they will win. Learning goals lead people to try learn as much as possible.
- With performance, intelligence has a [[Proxy]] of success. This could be a reason people may take on challenges they will succeed in if they are performance based.
- Memory palaces can be used to store information and also orgainises it.
- Memorization comes after mastery. Premature memorization can lead to ignoring connections.
- The bun method can be a strategy to memorize a lot of things.

## Actionable Steps
- Learn memorisation techniques.
- Place emphasis on learning rather than memorisation.
- Ensure proper study practices.

# Chapter 8
## Thoughts
- This chapter is mainly an exercise in [[Delayed feedback]]. The author mentions people wanted more specific feedback and thus wrote this chapter. They do mention summary sheets though.
