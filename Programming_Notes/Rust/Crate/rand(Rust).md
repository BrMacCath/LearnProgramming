# Purpose
This package can be used to generate random numbers.

# Issues?

In [[Guessing Game(Rust)|guessing game]], we use rand::Rng but in the code we only use rand.  I had been thinking that :: was a way of getting a subfolder of a folder but it seems like it does more than that. It was mentioned that this is going to be further explored in Chapter 10.
