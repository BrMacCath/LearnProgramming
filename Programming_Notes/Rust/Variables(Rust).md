# Purpose
So we need to create data in Rust. It seems like data is does not start off mutable.

# Example

To create a variable we use the let keyword like below

```Rust
let num = 5;
```
But if we wish to change things we need to add *mut* in between the variable and let.

```Rust
let mut num = 4;
```
