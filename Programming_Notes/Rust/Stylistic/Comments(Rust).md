# Purpose
These are included in code to help other people understand what you are doing. The begin with //. The book mentions that there are more types of commenting but I am going to stick with the book for now.

# Example


```Rust

fn main(){
	// This function prints 5.
	println!("5");
}
```

## Crates

Can have comments on crates too. The difference is that these are triple forward slashes.
