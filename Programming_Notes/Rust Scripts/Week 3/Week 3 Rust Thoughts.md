# First Draft
## Reflections
Topic: Reflecting about the process so far.
- Focused on external parts of this process. 
- Need to examine internally.
- Need to examine the methods of internal examination.
- 

I started this process by examining people's strategies to make scripts,videos etc. A major component of this website was reflection but I did not put the same energy into reflections. In going forward, I am going to have a section about reflections and examine not just how to reflect but also try to examine what is useful in those reflections. Meta reflections!
