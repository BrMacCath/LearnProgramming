# First Draft
## Rust

Topic: Unit Types

Rust has a [[Unit(Rust)|unit]] type that comes up implicitly in [[functions(Rust)|functions]].  It is the type after fn () when there are no inputs. It is also compiled in if there are no outputs? (Double check idea and wording). I wonder how many times we have the compiler hide these sorts of issues. I think with Rust there is something called [[Generic Data Types(Rust)| generic data types]].
 
---
Topic: Enum
So [[Enum(Rust)|enum]] is a way of grouping data types together. I am wondering if we can use [[Arrays(Rust)|arrays]] and functions build off of [[Pattern Matching(Rust)|pattern matching]] to have methods that work on functions of multiple data types. I don't know if this is possible but I think it should be? I am going to try create an example myself once enum is covered.


---
Topic: The downside of flexibility

I used to think flexibility was better in general, automatically good. The older I get, the more I disagree in that having more rigidity can guarantee certain things. I thought it was interesting that this applied to programming. With [[Compound types(Rust)|compound data types]], the more flexibility, the less methods you can guarantee to have for your data types. This is a situation that would directly opposed to how I have previously thought about things. It seems to me the more flexible the base, the more rigid the applications are and vice versa. I am noticing this in other facets of my life too.


## Obsidian

Topic: How tp can be effected.

In Obsidian templater we get access to tp automatically. An issue I have is that I don't know what this object really is? I assume it is an object in programming and there are methods attached to it but I could be completely wrong. My misunderstanding cost me a lot of time as when creating new files with tp, it effects the note you are currently on in ways I don't understand. I will have to look into this.

---
Topic: The versatility of APIs in obsidian templater.

The range of plugins for Obsidian is one of its main selling points. There are ranges of helpful tools such as Kanaban, Dataview, templater, etc that people can find useful. One thing I completely underestimated was the utility of APIs interacting with each other. Using Dataview and meta-edit you can create interactive tables that automatically update your files. 
## Blender

Topic: Smaller sections

A massive mistake I made the first time when building my first video is that I had large video sections to build the end video. I am now building smaller video sections and then stitching them together at the end.

---

Topic: Low pass filters

When planning my first video I was thinking a lot about the animation/visual display. I needed to get the video out so I accepted that there were going to be issues. One of my goals for this video was to make sure that there was no crackling in the background and the sound remained close to constant. Blender has a feature called low pass filter that lets you remove background noise. I think a lot of other programs have it too but I will try to figure out how to use it properly as I progress.

## Animation

Topic: For loops in Manim.

I knew that Manim allowed for animations to be created in a programmatic way.  I knew that this allowed for small changes to be easy enough to program. One thing I did not realise was how useful for loops would be in Manim. For the script [[Compounding data types(Rust)|compounding data types]], I needed to make an animation that put a numbers beside letters one after the other. This ended up as a for loop that was a lot easier to build than I expected.


## Miscellaneous

Topic: Drafts are amazing!

English was never my strong point in secondary school and I did not try to do many drafts of my work. Honestly I regret this now as I can see how much they show the flaws in my writing. It may take me time to fix these issues but if I never even notice them I have no hope of correcting them.

---

Topic: Process is key.

Doing this project involves me using a lot of skills that I don't have much experience in such as video editing. 

---

Topic: Automate boring.

When building this project, I tried to follow some writing processes in order to improve my writing. This meant having to process a lot of sentences, examine them individually and then tie them together again at the end for each script (including this one). To do this on paper, this can be a little bit tedious but on a computer this was especially aggravating. Fortunately, as I am using Obsidian so I can make use of plugins such as templater that can add, alter and remove a lot of files. Furthermore, it became really interesting to actually automate the process.

---

Topic: Creating a process in public.
When building this project, a major component of this was to learn in public. In doing so though, I have come to realise that the methods I am using to learn things are incorrect. I went into this thinking I could apply the methods that had worked for me before and they now working against me! In trying to learn publicly, a major piece of the work seems to be making a process publicly.

## Blender



Topic: Smaller sections

A massive mistake I made the first time when building my first video is that I had large video sections to build the end video.
> I started making videos with the main topics in mind. When building the script I did not think of the process in relation to the video component. When I worked on the script, I did not properly factor in the visual display. However, the script is a part of the video not all of it. Furthermore, when writing the script, I did not factor in the time it takes to record audio. I tried to make large chunks of text all at once. This is impractical as I find it really difficult to make that audio. Then fixing mistakes can be tedious as I may need to figure out how to re record a line in the middle of a two minute recording. I will have to learn how to balance audio as well.

I am now building smaller video sections and then stitching them together at the end.
> I now build smaller video sections and then stich them together.

Topic: Low pass filters

When planning my first video I was thinking a lot about the animation/visual display.
> When making these videos, my focus was on the script or the visuals. This came at the expense of audio.

I needed to get the video out so I accepted that there were going to be issues.
> I accepted that there were going to be issues. To improve, I need to focus on them to fix them.

One of my goals for this video was to make sure that there was no crackling in the background and the sound remained close to constant.
> In my first video, one issue was crackling in the background of the audio. There were other issues too but I decided to focus on this one.

Blender has a feature called low pass filter that lets you remove background noise.
> Blender has a feature called a low pass filter that lets you remove background noise. It also appears in OBS too.

I think a lot of other programs have it too but I will try to figure out how to use it properly as I progress.
> I think this may be a common feature in audio programs.

## Miscellaneous



Topic: Drafts are amazing!

English was never my strong point in secondary school and I did not try to do many drafts of my work.
> Writing was not my strong point in secondary school. I often just wrote down what I thought was needed to get through the class. I don't think I ever did second drafts of my writing.

Honestly I regret this now as I can see how much they show the flaws in my writing.
> I regret this now. I can see my flaws in my writing better even I still need to drastically improve. 

It may take me time to fix these issues but if I never even notice them I have no hope of correcting them.
> It still takes a lot of time to fix these issues, but if I never notice them I can't correct them. Also, I actually enjoy this more when I make drafts. I wonder if it is because I can see improvements or I can write more of what I actually think down. I definitely had moments where I have reread something from months ago and I have no idea what I was talking about.

Topic: Process is key

Doing this project involves me using a lot of skills that I don't have much experience in such as video editing.
> Doing this project involved learning skills that I previously thought of myself as very weak in. One thing that I have really begun to appreciate is having a process. This was something that I didn't implement a lot unless I needed to to succeed. There were times when I adapted but it often felt like a last resort rather than a practical, immediate step to a new situation. With writing and video editing, having a process to help me progress has been so helpful (getting advice from other people has been helpful too!). One aspect I want to build on is a process to create processes. I wish to be less reactive to situations.

> This involved writing a lot of sentences and then examining each of them individually. We can reformat the sentences to be more precise and informative. At the end we can tie them together again. I did this with each script, including this one! This process needs to be done for each draft.

> I learned this process from someone writing on paper. Carrying out this process on paper is fine. On computers, I found it **extremely** tedious. 

Fortunately, as I am using Obsidian so I can make use of plugins such as templater that can add, alter and remove a lot of files.
> An advantage of Obsidian is that I can use/make plugins to help workflow. I created JavaScript code that immediately converted the rough draft into sentences that could be examined easily. Furthermore, I also made code that takes each new sentence at the end and creates paragraphs from them.

Furthermore, it became really interesting to actually automate the process.
> I really began to enjoy automating the process too! I might record the process of taking these actions in future.

Topic: Creating a process in public

When building this project, a major component of this was to learn in public.
> I have been really impressed by people who learn in public. When creating my videos, I decided to do the same.

In doing so though, I have come to realise that the methods I am using to learn things are incorrect.
> Part of the process of learning is making mistakes. I have already made quite a few.

I went into this thinking I could apply the methods that had worked for me before and they now working against me! In trying to learn publicly, a major piece of the work seems to be making a process publicly.
> I thought I could just (blindly) apply strategies that have worked for me before. This did not work. I spent years learning how to study math and those strategies took years to learn. While some skills can  (and have!) transferred over, some don't, or at least not without some more intentional effort.

## Obsidian



Topic: How tp can be effected

In Obsidian templater we get access to tp automatically.
> Obsidian templater has an object tp that we have access to straight away. We can use it to access, modify and create files among other things inside templater.

An issue I have is that I don't know what this object really is? I assume it is an object in programming and there are methods attached to it but I could be completely wrong.
> We use tp to access the features available to templater. An issue I have is that I am not sure of the structure of this object. It has data attached that can be altered by methods but it is not updated in the ways I would assume.

My misunderstanding cost me a lot of time as when creating new files with tp, it effects the note you are currently on in ways I don't understand.
> This arose from when I was creating new files with tp. I think that the data associated with tp is related to the last file it has made. Then when I try to use data associated with the file I want to make, the data has changed and I therefore no longer have access to it. The method I chose to solve this was to change the order that the files were created in. When I am using the templater to create a file with the current file, I create that first and then create any secondary files. This works but I should investigate how tp works considering how much I use it.

I will have to look into this.

One thing I completely underestimated was the utility of APIs interacting with each other.
> Added to this, we can combine plugins together to be even more effective. We can use the api's for the plugins with templater. Quick Add can also use other plugins.

> We can use Dataview and meta-edit to create interactive tables to automatically update your files. You will get an option to fill in what you wish the new data to be. You can also add metadata menu to your system so that you can restrict what the possibilities could be. I use it so that my tables only have a couple of options to chose from.

# Final Draft

## Animation



Topic: For loops in Manim

Manim is made to create animations using programming. An advantage was that small changes can be easy to implement. I did not account for how useful for loops could be. In the script [[Compounding data types(Rust)|compounding data types]], I made an animation that put a list of numbers beside letters one after the other. This was just a for loop in the end.
