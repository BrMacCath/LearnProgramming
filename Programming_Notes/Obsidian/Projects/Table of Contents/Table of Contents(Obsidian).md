# Purpose

Create a table of contents plugin that automatically updates and is compatible with Obsidian publish.


# Road Map

1. Create a table of contents on a file just with [[JavaScript]]. ✅
	 > The plugins use Typescript which is based off JavaScript. I tried to build it the simplest version possible.
2.  Move the table of contents program into a community plugin. ✅
	 > This is my first time making a community plugin. I have got this working on my laptop but I need to get this app approved on the community plugin page.
3. Get the app approved on github. ❌
	 > I need to submit a pull request. I thought I had done it but I haven't got a response. As this is my first time doing this I assume I did something wrong and I need to get a video/guide and try this again.
4. Figure out a method to track where the table of contents is within the file. ✅
	 > I can use comments to locate where the table of contents is within the file. 
5.  Find out how to replace the contents of a section of a file. ❌
	> I will need to learn to use some editor replace methods which I have not done before but I'll figure it out.
6. Allow for different styles of table of contents. ❌
	> I have seen other plugins that allow for different kinds of table of contents such as bullet points or arrows.
