# Video Goals
## Record myself

This will be the first video where I am video recording myself. I have been trying new things with posting videos and I have been avoiding doing this. It does not make sense so I will record myself so that I can see that its not that bad.

## Add in animation

I don't want to drop doing animations. I hope to keep that within this video but I will not add it if it does not make sense to do so.
## Admit to topics/chapters you don't understand

I think a large part of this project is to humble myself. To do I will admit to things I do not understand. I think my ego sometimes holds me back. I chose philosophy as I don't have any identity attachment to it and it could be interesting.
