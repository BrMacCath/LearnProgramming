# Key Points
- Referenced throughout the book
- Positive spiritual ambience.
- Living in accordance with it is beneficial.


# First Draft

Topic: What is Tao
- Not entirely sure but it is referenced repeatedly.
- Starts off with it.
- Comes in mention with other themes I've seen so far too!

The first theme I am mentioning is Tao. It is referenced through Tao Te Ching^[ [[Tao Te Ching]] ] and is introduced from the start of the book on the very first page^[Chapter 1]. My general understanding is that Tao is a form of spiritual ambience and that living in accordance with it brings life meaning/enjoyment. It exists from before the universe. It emphasizes balance(cite) and humility(cite). When going through this it reminded me of meditations by Marcus Aurelius in that regard. This will be expanded upon momentarily.

Topic: Called out by an ancient text.
- Personal flaws mentioned by an ancient text.
- Issues date back so long.
- Thought it was funny.

Mention one of the pages that had mentioned a personal issue and just talk about how it was funny.

Topic: Pre-empting criticism
- Criticising people who disregard Tao as foolish.
- Recognising that Tao is important is good.
- Emotional manipulation.

Regarding people who recognise Tao as important can be emotionally manipulative. Elevating them above people could make someone want to say that while also admitting we only have a sliver of the concept of Tao.^[Chapter 41]
