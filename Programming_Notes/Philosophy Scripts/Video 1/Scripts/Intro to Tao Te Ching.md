Topic: Welcome to the channel
- Welcome people to the channel.
- Practice making videos and learning.
- Pewdiepie video.

Hi everyone, welcome to the channel I don't understand Philosophy.  I made this channel to practice learning and making videos. I chose to learn philosophy as I thought it was interesting and i am curious about the philosophy of science. The books I am going to be reading come from PewdiePie's philosophy list. As learning is about connections I will be using obsidian to store my notes. Obsidian is a note taking app that emphasises linking data together. It also has a feature called publish that allows you to  I will also be publicly sharing my content and process using obsidian publish. That will be linked below.

Topic: Layout of the video.
- Center on themes.
- Discuss sections that were interested in.
- Admit Bias.
The layout of each video will be to discuss themes I found in each section, backing them up with examples. The first book I am going to read is Tao Te Ching, a book of philosophy from Ancient China. The themes I will be talking about are Tao, context can be the difference between a weakness and a strength and process over result. I have a strong personal bias with these themes. These ideas have been occurring in my own personal life and I can see it affecting the way I read this text. I am going to try to keep that in mind but I will just own that this is something that I am doing, sometimes intentionally. I think it is impossible to completely remove my bias so I am just going to try focus on being aware of it. I am also going to talk about pages I did not understand. Let's get into the video!
