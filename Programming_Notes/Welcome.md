# Welcome

This is going to be my vault while I learn Rust! You are welcome to join along! We will be talking about recent changes and making projects! Note that as my process is updating, the formatting of old scripts can be very different to the formatting of current scripts.

## Current Thoughts


## Community Plugins

Topic: Trying to contribute back
- Obsidians plugins are class.
- It'd be nice to give back. 
- Its crazy that these are not just available but also free.


## Building a Project
Topic: Random side tangents
- Not knowing what you need.
- Avoiding premature optimisation.
- Avoiding zero optimisation.


## Graphing the project
Topic: Utilising mermaid Diagrams.
- Task management is super important.
- Need a way to segment the process.
- Mermaid diagrams are super useful in showing how to breakup a task.

# Rust Script this week

## Current Thoughts

## Reflections
Topic: Reflecting about the process so far.
- Focused on external parts of this process. 
- Need to examine internally.
- Need to examine the methods of internal examination.
- 

I started this process by examining people's strategies to make scripts, videos etc. A major component of this website was reflection but I did not put the same energy into reflections. In going forward, I am going to have a section about reflections and examine not just how to reflect but also try to examine what is useful in those reflections. Meta reflections!
