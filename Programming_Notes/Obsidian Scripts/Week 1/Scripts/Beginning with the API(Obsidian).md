# Script Goal

## Key points
- how to get a community plugin.
- adjust to TypeScript.
- Also recognise npm.

# First Draft
Topic: Starting off with Plugins
- Examining how people started with plugins.
- Found some great YouTube videos on this.
- As a tutorial I think this one was really great. I am going to focus on the code for my video.

Now that I have an idea for a plugin and the pseudo code for a first draft, I need to start building code. To do this I watched a YouTuber, Florian Ludewig, who had an amazing video on how to start building a community plugin. He proceeded to go through common pitfalls and gave a tutorial where he showed multiple methods that were useful in building an app. I have linked the video below and I highly recommend it. To start building the community plugin, Obsidian gives you a sample plugin to build off of. You can fork it to your GitHub and then start editing it.

Topic: Tools you need
- Typescript versus javascript
- Null errors


An important point to note is that creating plugins in Obsidian is done in Typescript rather than JavaScript. This was not too difficult but one issue I ran into a lot was misusing void as an output. Sometimes I put it where it was not needed. Other times I needed it and I hadn't put it there. I was using VS Code and an extension helped me to resolve these issues fairly quickly. An important step was converting my pseudo code into methods on the objects.

# Final Draft

Now that I have a rough idea for a plugin I need to build it. This means getting code up and running and working with the API system in Obsidian.

Obsidian plugins are build in Typescript. I had used JavaScript before but the transition to Typescript was not too difficult for this.
