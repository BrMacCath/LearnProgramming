# Script Goal

## Key points
- Desire to make an app.
- Start with something I can use.
- Admit that someone has already done this.
- Thats okay.
- Process.

# First Draft
Topic: Desire to make something I can use.
- In obsidian I use a lot of community plugins.
- There is Dataview, metadata-edit,etc.
- I'd like to contribute so I am going to make my own!
- Something I would use.
- Other people have done this.

Hi all! My goal for this project is to create a table of contents plugin for Obsidian. My desire for doing this is that I use a lot of community plugins such as metadata-edit and the home plugin and I want to contribute. It could also be good experience. The reason I chose a table of contents app is that I think I would find it useful in my own notes and the current popular (and extremely useful) one is missing some functionality that I would like to have. Namely, that if I update my note, I want to be able to update my table of contents. Furthermore, I would also like to be able to use this functionality with obsidian publish. There are community plugins that let you automatically update your table of contents but they do not work with obsidian publish.

Topic: Process of this.
- Goal is to start with a idealised process.
- Start small and add complexity.


To do this I intend to intend to start with the simplest version of creating a table of contents and then add on complexity later on. Obsidian uses JavaScript so before building this function with an application program interface, I will just build it as a function in my vault. For this project, I will start off without trying to have the table of contents updatable. Also I will not allow the table of contents to be placed anywhere but the start. We will also assume some structure of the file. This is done so that there are no difficult cases to start. When this is done I will then start trying to add it as a community plugin for Obsidian.

# Second Draft

Hi all! My goal for this project is to create a table of contents plugin for Obsidian.
> Hi everyone. This project is to create a plugin for Obsidian. The plugin will create table of contents for files based on the headings.

 My desire for doing this is that I use a lot of community plugins such as metadata-edit and the home plugin and I want to contribute.
> This desire starts from two causes, starting with experiencing all the plugins that obsidian has to offer. There are plugins such as metaData nenu and the home plugin that I use everyday. I would like to contribute to this community if possible.

 It could also be good experience.
> It could also be good experience to build a program myself.

 The reason I chose a table of contents app is that I think I would find it useful in my own notes and the current popular (and extremely useful) one is missing some functionality that I would like to have.
> I chose to make a plugin that makes a table of contents as I think this could be useful. There are two popular plugins that do this already but both are missing some functionality that I would like. The most popular one allows you to build a table of contents anywhere but it does not update as the file updates. As my file changes I still want the ability for the table of contents to change. The second one updates your notes but does it not work with obsidian publish. As I am posting my notes online, this does not work for me.

 Namely, that if I update my note, I want to be able to update my table of contents.
>

To do this I intend to intend to start with the simplest version of creating a table of contents and then add on complexity later on.
> My goal is to start small to get a working model. I intend to add more features as the model works.

 Obsidian uses JavaScript so before building this function with an application program interface, I will just build it as a function in my vault.
> Obsidian uses JavaScript so, before using the touching the application program interface of Obsidian, I will build a JavaScript function in my vault.

 For this project, I will start off without trying to have the table of contents updatable.
> To simplify further, I will not have the table of contents updatable to start and the table of contents will be positioned at the start of the note.

 Also I will not allow the table of contents to be placed anywhere but the start.
> 

 We will also assume some structure of the file.
> We will also assume some structure to the file.

 This is done so that there are no difficult cases to start.
> Edge cases can be dealt with later.

 When this is done I will then start trying to add it as a community plugin for Obsidian.
> When this is done I will integrate it with the application program interface protocols of Obsidian. By the end of this video I aim to have a working model in place!
