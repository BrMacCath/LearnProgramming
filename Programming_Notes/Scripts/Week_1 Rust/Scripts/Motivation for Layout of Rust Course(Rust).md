# Script Goal

## Key points
- Open learning is a concept I heard from Nicole Van der Oven. 
- It is publicly displaying what you are learning and updating/ reviewing your knowledge.
- Doing so also reminds me of the Feynman Technique in which you try to explain why and how you did something.
- I also like the responsibility of being forced to explain a concept well.
- A downside is I probably won't be able to do this too well at the start as I am learning it myself too!


# First Draft

When starting this youtube channel, I knew I wanted it to be about learning new skills, starting with Rust, but I did not know what shape that would take. I thought I would try to use people who have interesting ways of presenting their content on YouTube. One creator I thought did an amazing job at this is Nicole Van Der Heoven, a YouTube creator who publishes content about obsidian online. From her, I heard of a concept called open learning. This is where you publicly display your knowledge, trying to engage people and help them understand. It also adds a layer of accountability. One issue with this is that it requires a lot writing which is something I have previously struggled with. To try fix this, I am not the first person to try figure out this issue I hoped to find someone who has strategies to do this. I found ( that guys name) and he mentioned a writing strategy document written by Dr. Jordan Peterson. I have found this pretty useful. Another part of this is that I am not just going to put up the end result but the steps in between. I will be posting sources below and I will be posting my process on Obsidian publish.

Topic: Strategy for learning Rust
- Proceed through the Rust book.
- Looking at the website there are plenty of options, probably going to look at webdevelopment.


How I am going to learn Rust is by going through the Rust book first. From here the official Rust website provides quite a few options, I am tempted to try learn web development as I learned a bit of Django and I have an idea for a website. This may  be a bad idea so I am going to hold off until I know more about Rust.

> Hi all! Welcome to my Youtube Channel. This channel is going to be about trying to learn new things publicly, beginning with Rust! To start my YouTube channel, I knew it was going to be about learning skills, but I was unsure of how to proceed in doing this.

I thought I would try to use people who have interesting ways of presenting their content on YouTube.
> To gather inspiration, I began looking at how other people do this.

One creator I thought did an amazing job at this is Nicole Van Der Heoven, a YouTube creator who publishes content about obsidian online. 
> I found an amazing creator, Nicole Van Der Hoeven, who publishes content about obsidian, a note organising app, online.

From her, I heard of a concept called open learning.
> Furthermore, she demonstrated a concept called learning in public with a website. (I've seen a few variations of this definition) This website is build using a tool called obsidian publish.

This is where you publicly display your knowledge, trying to engage people and help them understand. 
> Here, you can build a set of notes that can try to explain concepts and help others (and me!) understand.

It also adds a layer of accountability. 
> Furthermore it allows people to deeply question what you think you know.

One issue with this is that it requires a lot writing which is something I have previously struggled with. 
> A personal issue I have with this is that it requires a lot of writing, a weak point of mine.

To try fix this, I am not the first person to try figure out this issue I hoped to find someone who has strategies to do this. 
> I should fix this, even without this channel. This issue is not unique so I searched for people who have strategies to tackle this. 

I found ( that guys name) and he mentioned a writing strategy document written by Dr. Jordan Peterson. 
> I found a youTube channel, Python programmer, discussing a writing system by Dr. Jordan Peterson. 

I have found this pretty useful. 

> I think it is really good. I have not fully implemented the strategy yet as it is super time consuming and I want to make a YouTube video. This video has has been delayed weeks due to illness and the fact I have never edited a video before. I think I just need to get a video out to begin.

Another part of this is that I am not just going to put up the end result but the steps in between. I will be posting sources below and I will be posting my process on Obsidian publish.

> Another part of my process is to publish not just my end product but also steps I took along the way. This will be available on Obsidian publish which will be linked below.

# Final Draft


Hi all! Welcome to my Youtube Channel. This channel is going to be about trying to learn new things publicly, beginning with Rust! To start my YouTube channel, I knew it was going to be about learning skills, but I was unsure of how to proceed in doing this. To gather inspiration, I began looking at how other people do this. I found an amazing creator, Nicole Van Der Hoeven, who publishes content about obsidian, a note organising app, online. Furthermore, she demonstrated a concept called learning in public with a website. (I've seen a few variations of this definition) This website is build using a tool called obsidian publish.  Here, you can build a set of notes that can try to explain concepts and help others (and me!) understand. This is what is currently on the screen and a link will be available below. Furthermore it allows people to deeply question what you think you know. A personal issue I have with this is that it requires a lot of writing, a weak point of mine.  I should fix this, even without this channel. This issue is not unique so I searched for people who have strategies to tackle this. When I tried to search for how YouTube creaters did this, I often found a process and and clean edited final product with no steps inbetween. I decided that as I wanted to improve my writing, I would display the processes I've taken with writing scripts alongside the material I am learning in Rust.   


 I found a youTube channel, Python programmer, discussing a writing system by Dr. Jordan Peterson. 


 To start learning Rust, I decided to follow common strategies people use to do so. This led me to the Rust website and the Rust book. The book is a starting place but there seems to be quite a few avenues you can branch off from from there. I think I am going to look at web development as I have previously made a website with Django and I have a new idea for a website.  One thing to consider is that I don't understand Rust so I will wait until I know more before fully committing to that decision. While proceeding through this book, I am going to try make connections between Rust and other languages that I know small parts of. I have heard making connections between different languages can be useful in learning.
