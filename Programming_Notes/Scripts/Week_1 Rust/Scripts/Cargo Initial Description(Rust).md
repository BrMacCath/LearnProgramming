# Script Goal

## Key points

- Commonly used to build packages.
- Has commands that help you understand concepts: TOML dependencies. Has build and check commands.


# First Draft

While rustc can be used to compile code, in practice a tool called cargo is used. This allows you to use other packages and allows you to use commands to help you create your project. To use cargo you use the command cargo new_project and it will create a new folder that has structure to it.
