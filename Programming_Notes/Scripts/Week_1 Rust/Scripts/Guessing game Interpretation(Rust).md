# Script Goal

## Key points
Topic: Getting going with Rust
- To actually learn programming, you need to program.
- Testing out input features.
- what the game is about.
- Testing ideas.

## Algorithm Diagram
Topic: Techniques




# First draft

## First Paragraph
Topic: Programming is an active skill
- Programming is an participator skill. To learn it you must do it.
- Project that builds skills.
- Taking input
- Comparing it
- 

Programming is a participation skill. To learn it, you need to actively take part yourself. We will do this with the first project from the book, guessing a secret number. The project is to randomly generate a number, and by taking user's input, guide them towards the answer by saying higher or lower. This game helps build a set of skills such as identifying what types of data you should store data in, taking user inputs and making decisions based off of them. You will also learn how to deal with errors. We will start off using Cargo and highlighting how TOML is used within it. I am also going to try build diagrams of the algorithm as seen on the screen.


## Second Paragraph
Topic: Cargo process
- State the goals of this.
- 
So when we use Cargo to build this, we can create our TOML file with a lot of information within it. We can see the name and the dependencies on it. You can start swapping out versions of it that you want. Show experiment. Note that if you go try to use a version that does not exist it will cause errors. It will also tell you to specify if you want to beta test a version. 


## Third Paragraph
