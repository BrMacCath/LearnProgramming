# First Draft
## Rust

Topic: Unit Types

Rust has a [[Unit(Rust)|unit]] type that comes up implicitly in [[functions(Rust)|functions]].  It is the type after fn () when there are no inputs. It is also compiled in if there are no outputs? (Double check idea and wording). I wonder how many times we have the compiler hide these sorts of issues. I think with Rust there is something called [[Generic Data Types(Rust)| generic data types]]

Topic: Enum
So [[Enum(Rust)|enum]] is a way of grouping data types together. I am wondering if we can use [[Arrays(Rust)|arrays]] and functions build off of [[Pattern Matching(Rust)|pattern matching]] to have methods that work on functions of multiple data types. I don't know if this is possible but I think it should be? I am going to try create an example myself once enum is covered.

Topic: The downside of flexibility

I used to think flexibility was better in general, automatically good. The older I get, the more I disagree in that having more rigidity can guarantee certain things. I thought it was interesting that this applied to programming. With [[Compound types(Rust)|compound data types]], the more flexibility, the less methods you can guarantee to have for your data types. This is a situation that would directly opposed to how I have previously thought about things. It seems to me the more flexible the base, the more rigid the applications are and vice versa. I am noticing this in other facets of my life too.


## Obsidian

Topic: How tp can be effected.

In Obsidian templater we get access to tp automatically. An issue I have is that I don't know what this object really is? I assume it is an object in programming and there are methods attached to it but I could be completely wrong. My misunderstanding cost me a lot of time as when creating new files with tp, it effects the note you are currently on in ways I don't understand. I will have to look into this.

Topic: The versatility of apis in obsidian templater.

The range of plugins for Obisidian is one of its main selling points. There are ranges of helpful tools such as Kanaban, dataview, templater, etc that people can find useful. One thing I completely underestimated was the utility of apis interacting with each other. Using dataview and meta-edit you can create interactive tables that automatically update your files.

Topic: Creating a process in public.
When building this project, a major component of this was to learn in public. In doing so though, I have come to realise that the methods I am using to learn things are incorrect. I went into this thinking I could apply the methods that had worked for me before and they now working against me! In trying to learn publicly, a major piece of the work seems to be making a process publicly.
