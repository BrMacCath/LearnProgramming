# Script Goal

## Key points

- Functions have structure in Rust.
- In maths we have the function notation $f: A\to B$. Rust is the same.
- If there are no inputs or outputs, we drop the A or B respectively. If neither are there we also drop arrow.
- The last line without a ; is the return value. Find this annoying.


# First Draft
Topic: Function notation
- we have fn to denote function
- The function notation is same as maths.
- Sometimes they drop pieces of the notation if parts of it are missing.

Functions are denoted by fn in Rust. They follow the mathematical method of denoting functions in that they go function_name: Inputs ->outputs. When there are not inputs or outputs, the respective piece id dropped.  If there are neither, the arrow is dropped too. The purpose of the function takes place within curly parentheses. One feature that seems odd to me is if the last line does not have a semi-colon at the end of the line, it is treated as if we return it. I have no idea why that is done and I did not see why online. I will check again in future.

Topic: async functions
- async functions exist in Rust
- Have the same syntax as Javascript
- Wonder if there is a Promise.All statement.

As part of my future plan is to build a website with Rust I was wondering about asyncronous functions. Rust allows for async functions and has the same notation as JavaScript! The only thing you need to make a function asynchronous is to put async before fn. I was curious if more of the notation transferred and decided to look for the rust equivalent of Promise all. There seems to be a macro called join so I will take another look at this when I understand macros.

# Second Draft

Functions are denoted by fn in Rust.
> Functions are denoted by fn in Rust.

 They follow the mathematical method of denoting functions in that they go function_name: Inputs ->outputs.
> They follow the mathematical declaration of functions : function_name: Inputs ->outputs.

 When there are not inputs or outputs, the respective piece id dropped.
> If there are no inputs, the input piece is dropped. If there are no outputs, the output piece is dropped.

  If there are neither, the arrow is dropped too.
> When both are removed, the arrow is dropped too.

 The purpose of the function takes place within curly parentheses.
> The action of the function occurs within a pair of curly parenthesis.

 One feature that seems odd to me is if the last line does not have a semi-colon at the end of the line, it is treated as if we return it.
> A feature that struck me as odd is that if the last line does not have a semi-colon on it, it is treated as a return value.

 I have no idea why that is done and I did not see why online.
> I don't know why this is done.

 I will check again in future.

As part of my future plan is to build a website with Rust I was wondering about asyncronous functions.
> One of my goals with Rust is to build a website with it. To do so, I investigated whether asynchronous functions exist in Rust too as they are fundamental for web development.

 Rust allows for async functions and has the same notation as JavaScript! The only thing you need to make a function asynchronous is to put async before fn.
> Rust asynchronous functions with similar notation to JavaScript! To make a function asynchronous, we put async before fn.

 I was curious if more of the notation transferred and decided to look for the rust equivalent of Promise all.
> On this note, I wondered if promise all appeared in Rust. This is used to deal with asynchronous functions is JavaScript.

 There seems to be a macro called join so I will take another look at this when I understand macros.
> There seems to be a macro called join which takes its place. When I understand macros more I will take another look.
