# Learning Rust

## Current goal

- Learn in public.
- Explain what and why.
- Follow best practices.

I am using this repository as a record of my progress in learning Rust. I am implenting learning in public but I also wish to show my mistakes too. GitHub's features are useful for this as it tracks previous work. Also, if I truly understand these concepts, I should be able to explain them so I am making videos about what I am learning. With this goal in mind, there are several tools I am using to build this.

## Rust

To learn Rust, I decided to follow the main method that other people use and I am currently using the Rust book to learn things from.

## Obsidian

One method of learning a new topic is to link it with other areas you understand. Obsidian allows for this with its linked notes and programmatic way of making connections with meta-data. The community plugins are also incredibly useful and versatile.

## Manim

To demonstrate concepts, animations can be extremely useful. I intend to use Manim to try draw ideas in ways that people will find useful.
